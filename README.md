## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

This app encourages users to explore creativity with colors and typography. The inclusion of sliders for font size adjustments makes it ideal for design enthusiasts or as a simple teaching tool to demonstrate the principles of UI design.

## Notes

Challenges:

1. Understanding how to dynamically adjust all labelsâ€™ properties required careful iteration through the subviews of the main view.
2. Ensuring the font is stable when I scale it up using the slider.
3. Calculate the slider input value so it can show the text
4. Designing a user-friendly layout with clear accessibility for the slider and buttons.

Despite these challenges, the app provides an engaging experience for users to interact with colors and text properties intuitively.
